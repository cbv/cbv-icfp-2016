Approximate Solutions:
----------------------
- "translate the square to cover the silhouette"

- Approximate by folding on all edges of the convex hull of the silhouette (repeatedly).


Exact Solutions that are probably slow:
---------------------------------------
- Exact search: unwrap faces from skeleton.

- Will skeleton be provided as hint with all solutions?


Hard Problems:
--------------
- lots of small faces during search
- use really long (greater than 64 bits) integers
